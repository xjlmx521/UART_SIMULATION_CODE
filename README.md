# UART_SIMULATION_CODE
Use a single GPIO pin to simulate UART tx function which can be used to print debug information through a RS232 to the computer. After optimization, my code can use 2M badurate speed(With system CLOCK up to 32Mhz) to print the log info. User can also freely to configure the baud rate according to their needs.
